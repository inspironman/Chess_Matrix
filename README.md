Chess Matrix was my first project in Object Oriented Programming.
To see the code and documentation please check cm1.

Implement the chessboard matrix type which contains integers. In these matrices, every 
second entry is zero. The entries that can be nonzero are located like the samecolored 
squares on a chessboard, with indices (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), ..., (2, 2), (2, 4), .... The zero 
entries are on the indices (1, 2), (1, 4), ..., (2, 1), (2, 3), ... Store only the entries that can be 
nonzero in row-major order in a sequence. Don't store the zero entries. Implement as 
methods: getting the entry located at index (i, j), adding and multiplying two matrices, 
and printing the matrix (in a shape of m by n)
